\section{Introduction}

This document describes how to set up and use the field monitoring system based on a Raspberry Pi base station and Moteino/Arduino based loggers. It provides a 
description of the hardware used and how to set up specific parameters in software, such as logging frequency.

\section{Using the software}

\subsection{Base station (Raspberry Pi)}
The SD card image provided has everything already set up, but there are some more details here if you need to change anything. If you just want to set up a new Pi with the
provided image, go to \textbf{Setting up the Pi: Simple}. \break

The Raspberry Pi is set up so that it automatically runs a script when it starts. This script listens for any input from the controller and then captures and saves an image
using the camera. Then it shuts down the pi. This script is located in \textit{/home/pi/scripts} and it runs from \textit{/etc/rc.local}. Scripts run from \textit{rc.local}
run as the ``root'' user (similar to Administrators in Windows). You can look at this file by typing \textit{cat /etc/rc.local}. The Raspberry Pi is turned off and off
by the controller; it turns the Pi on, waits for it to complete its tasks, then turns it off.

\subsection{Logger (Moteino)}
The logger is the Moteino with the light sensor array attached. It runs from 2 x AA batteries and has a low power radio to send data back to the controller. The controller
that the logger is sending data back to must have the same \textbf{NETWORK\_ID} as the logger, or they can't communicate. \break

When setting up a new logger, there are a few things that you need to change, and a few things that you can change if you want to. As a minimum, you need to:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Check that the logger is on the right network, so that it can communicate with the right controller
 \item Check that the logger's \textbf{LOGGER\_ID} is unique on it's network
 \item Check that the logging frequency is correct
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{LOGGER\_ID}
The \textbf{LOGGER\_ID} is the unique number of the logger.
